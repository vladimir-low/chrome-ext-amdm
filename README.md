# AMDM Tabs Searcher
Chrome extension to search for tabs at www.amdm.ru

## Overview
The extension helps to search for your favorite song's tab at AMDM.RU quicker and easier.

It automatically sorts the result out by number of views in descending order. So that you'll get the most popular tabs.

It also stores your search inputs so you can choose it from drop-down. It won't go away even when you close you browser.

## Install
To install the extension, execute the following steps:
1. Download zipped archive of the extension from GitHub.
2. Unzip it into a folder with Google Chrome extensions in your computer (create one if it doesn't exist).
   - or see alternative option in [Update](#update) section.
3. In Google Chrome, go to Extensions Manager by typing in a new tab: `chrome://extensions/`
4. Load unpacked extension by choosing the right folder containing the code.

As a result **AMDMD Tabs Searcher**'s icon appears in your browser. Click on it, fill a fields and click search button. Have fun by playing your favourite music!

### Dependencies
The extension depends on JQuery library which is included into the package. No additional libraries are required.

## Un-install
To remove an extension from your browser, click **Remove** button below the extension in Google Chrome Extension Manager (see the link above). Then you can go ahead and remove the folder from your computer.

## Update
It's always a good idea to stay up to date and have new features/fixes installed. You can do it in 2 ways:
1. Constantly check GitHub repo for any new tags and repeat [installation steps](#install).
2. Pull the code instead of downloading .zip archive. In this case you'll need just to pull for a new code base and **Refresh** you extension in the browser.

## Contribution
I'm constantly looking for improving the project. Feel free to submit the issue in GitHub if you find one or even send Pull requests with fixes or new cool features.
